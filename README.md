# ATM Simulation (Python)

##  Project Description
This project is a simple ATM Simulation developed using Python.
It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as withdrawing money, depositing money, and checking account balance after PIN authentication.

##  Features
* Secure PIN login
* Withdraw money
* Deposit money
* Check account balance
* Input validation for insufficient balance

##  Technologies Used
* Python
* Conditional statements
* User input handling
* Basic arithmetic operations

##  How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open the Python file in VS Code or any Python IDE
3. Run the program
4. Enter PIN and select transaction option

## Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand:

* Conditional logic in Python
* Menu-driven programs
* Functionality simulation of real-world ATM
* Basic banking operations logic
